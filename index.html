        <h1> Hello World! </h1>
            <p1> I am a senior Computer Science major expecting to graduate in August 2021. I have three years of expereience developing, testing, and debugging code. I am most proficient with the C++, SQL, HTML, and CSS languaes. I do have expereience using PHP, Python, and Bash.</p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p1>I am adept at using a combination of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to write efficient programs. I am currently looking for employment or internship oppurtunities as a software developer or engineer where I can apply the skills that I have learned. Web development is another area that I believe that I can perform adequately and am interested in.  I do have experience with database management using MySQL and have enjoyed using that skill in tandem with PHP to create dynamic websites and web applications. Cyber security is an area that I am very interested in as well. My long term goals are to end up in any of these three fields.</p1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p1>On the left you will see some areas where you can reach out to me via social media or head over to my GitHub profile and view some of the projects that I have recently been working on and uploaded. If you have any want to reach me about employment, internship, or project collaboration oppurtunities please feel free to.</p1>
